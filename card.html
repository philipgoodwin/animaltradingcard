				<p>Beavers are herbivores that eat leaves, roots, aquatic plants, and bark.</p> 
				<p>A beaverâ€™s incisors grow its entire life but gnawing on trees keeps them a reasonable length. Beavers construct dams to flood areas, which gives them access to food and provides protection within their lodges.</p>
